              "'\\n\\nOppenheimer ( OP-ən-hy-mər) is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The story predominantly focuses on Oppenheimer\\'s studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film stars Cillian Murphy as the title character, Emily Blunt as his wife, \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\\nThe film was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan\\'s screenplay, following Nolan\\'s conflict with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest of the cast joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. Oppenheimer was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65\\xa0mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time in history, sections in IMAX black-and-white film photography. Like his previous works, Nolan used extensive practical effects and minimal computer-generated imagery. Oppenheimer is Nolan\\'s first film to receive an R-rating in the United States since Insomnia in 2002.\\nOppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal. Its simultaneous release with Warner Bros.\\' Barbie led to the \"Barbenheimer\" cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer has grossed over $671 million worldwide on a $100 million production budget, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, and the seventh highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. It received critical acclaim, with particular praise for the cast performances, screenplay, and visuals.\\n\\nPlot\\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer studies under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Oppenheimer is homesick and suffers from anxiety while struggling with the required lab work. Oppenheimer, upset with the demanding Blackett, leaves him a poison-laced apple but retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr is impressed enough by Oppenheimer\\'s intellect to recommend that he should instead study theoretical physics in Germany, where Oppenheimer completes his PhD. He later meets theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg at a conference in Switzerland. \\nOppenheimer returns to the United States, wanting to expand quantum physics research there. He begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology, starting with one student. He meets his future wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and also has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a member of the Communist Party USA. In 1938, Nazi Germany\\'s progress in nuclear fission research spurs Oppenheimer and his colleagues to replicate their results.\\nIn 1942, amid World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb after Oppenheimer gives assurances that he has no communist sympathies. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis\\' potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. Oppenheimer assembles a scientific team including Edward Teller and Isidor Isaac Rabi in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi and David L. Hill. As the work continues, Oppenheimer learns of Tatlock\\'s suicide.\\nAfter Germany surrenders, some project scientists question the bomb\\'s relevance, while Oppenheimer believes using it will quickly end the ongoing war in the Pacific, saving Allied lives. However, he and Albert Einstein had discussed the small possibility that an atomic detonation could trigger an atmospheric chain reaction and destroy the world. The Trinity test is successful and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan\\'s surrender. Oppenheimer is thrust into the public eye as the \"father of the atomic bomb\", but the immense destruction and mass fatalities haunt him. He urges Truman to restrict further nuclear weapon development, which Truman dismisses.\\nAs an advisor to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Oppenheimer advocates against further nuclear research, especially the hydrogen bomb proposed by Edward Teller. Oppenheimer\\'s stance becomes a point of contention amid the tense Cold War with the Soviet Union. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer after he dismissed Strauss\\'s concerns about exporting radioisotopes, publicly humiliating him, and for recommending arms talks with the Soviet Union.\\nAt a hearing intended to eliminate Oppenheimer\\'s political influence, Teller and other associates betray him while Strauss exploits Oppenheimer\\'s past associations with Communist Party members. Despite allies testifying in his defense, Oppenheimer\\'s security clearance is revoked, damaging his public image and neutralizing his policy influence. At Strauss\\'s later Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss\\'s personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer\\'s downfall. The U.S. Senate votes against Strauss\\'s nomination.\\nA flashback shows a conversation between Einstein and Oppenheimer in which Strauss erroneously believed Oppenheimer denigrated him. Oppenheimer had actually shared his fears with Einstein that nuclear weapons could ultimately lead to a nuclear holocaust.\\n\\nCast\\nProduction\\nDevelopment\\nFollowing the 2005 publication of the biography American Prometheus by Bird and Sherwin, director Sam Mendes had been interested in adapting the book into a film. After that project failed to materialize, and the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the next 15 years, the authors grew pessimistic about seeing their work adapted to the screen. In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus. In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan\\'s science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book of Oppenheimer\\'s speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed the physicist \"wrestling with the implications ... of what\\'s happened and what [he\\'s] done.\" Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\" in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.In December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with the studio on each one of his films starting with Insomnia (2002), was outraged with the decision as he had been a proponent of film theaters. In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan\\'s next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros. By mid-2021, the filmmaker had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project. Nolan had previously supported the studio\\'s decision to give Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) a simultaneous release, stating that he perceived that situation to have been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of Tenet.In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film set during World War II about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star. Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios for the project, including Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and Apple Studios. According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process in relation to the replacement of CEO and chairman Jim Gianopulos with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases. Nolan had connections to Donna Langley, the chairman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, who agreed with his stance in favor of traditional film exhibition in theaters. As such, Universal agreed to finance and distribute Oppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022. The studio also agreed to Nolan\\'s terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film\\'s first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the film\\'s release in which Universal could not release another new film.\\nWriting\\nOppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer\\'s perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale. He began developing the script after he completed Tenet and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years. A major plot element is Oppenheimer\\'s response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\". He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively, with most of Oppenheimer\\'s view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character\\'s point of view\". Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer\\'s conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy. Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.\\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer\\'s own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life. As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock\\'s influence on Oppenheimer\\'s life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer\\'s] later life and his ultimate fate\". Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984).Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer\\'s perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he\\'d been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer\\'s perception\". He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\". For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to have a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".Nolan first became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer\\'s deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985). He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety. Nolan had also penned a script for a biographic film on Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\\'s life. Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, the actor did what he summarized as \"an awful lot of reading\" on Oppenheimer\\'s life and had also been inspired by David Bowie\\'s appearance in the 1970s. Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterwards, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan\\'s hotel room by September 2020. Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer\\'s gaunt appearance.The casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, earning $4\\xa0million each in lieu of their usual $10–20\\xa0million upfront salary. Downey went to Nolan\\'s house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper. Downey described Oppenheimer as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date. Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like. Damon\\xa0– who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014)\\xa0– was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to Oppenheimer as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film. Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021). Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.The film also marks the first time in many years that Nolan did not cast Michael Caine, who had appeared in every Nolan film since Batman Begins (2005). When asked about Caine\\'s absence from the film, Nolan stated, \"He\\'s with us in spirit, but not an actual actor. No, no. He wasn\\'t able to join us for this one. But he\\'s always with us in spirit and I\\'ve had the most wonderful collaboration with him over the years.\"\\nFilming\\n\\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists. Another casting call was held in February.Principal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer. Gary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\". Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer\\'s visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".The film used a combination of IMAX 65\\xa0mm and 65 mm large-format film. It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the movie. In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Filming also occurred in California, primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.During a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town\\'s equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks. Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch. It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days. The production also shot some scenes on location in the real town of Los Alamos starting on March 8, 2022. Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to recreate those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and instead shot them inside a historic Women\\'s Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos. Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer\\'s original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy\\'s performance as Oppenheimer during filming.Filming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics. When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan\\'s famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb. Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert. The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather. A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect. Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film\\'s special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective. Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects. Filming wrapped in May 2022.\\nPost-production\\nDuring post-production, editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited Tenet. While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame had performed \"character passes\" in which they made sure that all the characters were properly displayed due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters. Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements, marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor. Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.\\nMusic\\nLudwig Göransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan\\'s previous film, Tenet. Göransson\\'s score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023. It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer\\'s central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds.\"\\nRelease\\nMarketing\\nOppenheimer\\'s teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29\\xa0a.m. (MST) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of Nope before being posted online on Universal\\'s social media profiles. Empire commented that it is exemplary of Nolan\\'s style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\". in December 2022, two trailers for the film premiered in front of Avatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online. In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.\\nTheatrical release\\nOppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13, and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17. Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early, and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere. SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures. In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70\\xa0mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).The film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel\\'s Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that Warner Bros.\\' decision to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was done in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer, as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal. Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\". In an interview with La Vanguardia, Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that\\'s cinema\\'s gain.\"As of March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Oppenheimer consequently did not have a Russian release.\\nIn Japan, the only country to have been attacked by nuclear bombs, the film is yet to have a release date. In late June 2023, a Universal Pictures spokesperson told Variety that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets.\" Variety also pointed out that it\\'s not uncommon for American films to be released in Japan months after the theatrical debut in the United States. The Economist suggested that due to the film\\'s controversial theme in Japan, it may never get released there.\\nClassifications and censorship\\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult guardian. It is Nolan\\'s first film to receive that rating since Insomnia (2002). In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\".In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh\\'s nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.\\nIndia\\n\\nIn India, Oppenheimer was released with all instances of nudity, sex and cigarette smoking scenes censored (but not cut) by the filmmakers, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time. The audio from the scene, where Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", while the two have intercourse, remained intact. As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.The Hindu right in India took offence at and demanded the removal of the scene. Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of Oppenheimer across the world. On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj, who played Krishna in the television series Mahabharat, told The Times of India that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer\\'s emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation [24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year], irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation [and] the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"Despite the opposition from Hindu fundamentalists, Oppenheimer was well received in most of the country.\\nReception\\nBox office\\nAs of August\\xa018, 2023, Oppenheimer has grossed $277.7\\xa0million in the United States and Canada, and $393.7\\xa0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $671.4\\xa0million.\\nUnited States and Canada\\nIn the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer was released alongside Barbie, and was originally projected to gross $45–50\\xa0million from 3,610 theaters in its opening weekend. The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day. After grossing $33\\xa0million on its first day (including $10.5\\xa0million from Thursday night previews), weekend estimates were raised to $77\\xa0million. It went on to debut to $82.5 million, finishing second behind Barbie and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama; 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for Oppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5\\xa0million people. The film\\'s opening weekend was Nolan\\'s best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from The Dark Knight trilogy. The film made $46.2\\xa0million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind Barbie. The film made $28.7\\xa0million in its third weekend, finishing third behind Barbie and newcomer Meg 2: The Trench. On August 16, Oppenheimer surpassed Sing to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.\\nOther territories\\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $98\\xa0million in its opening weekend. The following weekend, Oppenheimer earned $77.1\\xa0million, dropping by just 21% to become Nolan\\'s highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey. In its third weekend, Oppenheimer grossed $52.8 million for a decline of 31%. As of August 13, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($58.1\\xa0million), Germany ($35.4\\xa0million), France ($28\\xa0million), Australia ($21\\xa0million) and India ($17.7\\xa0million).\\nCritical response\\nCritics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly those of Murphy and Downey), and the visuals; it was frequently cited as one of the best films of 2023 up to that point, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 451 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy\\'s tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\". The A.V. Club\\'s Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it\\'s Christopher Nolan\\'s best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain\". Empire\\'s Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy\\'s performance and van Hoytema\\'s IMAX cinematography. Peter Suderman writing for Reason magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great and terrible. Oppenheimer isn\\'t just a movie—it\\'s a warning.\" Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com gave Oppenheimer a full four stars rating. He lauded Nolan\\'s storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer\\'s character, and the film\\'s technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, Oppenheimer is something else entirely—it\\'s hard to say exactly what, and that\\'s what\\'s so fascinating about it\". Peter Travers of ABC News described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you\\'ll see anywhere\". Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan\\'s] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of Memento, Inception and Tenet. IGN critic Siddhant Adlakha gave Oppenheimer 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan\\'s most \"abstract\" work yet. Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and stated: \"Oppenheimer, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\".Despite praising the film\\'s themes and performances, CNN\\'s Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie\\'s detriment\". While acknowledging the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason noted that the film omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans that ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\" Armond White of the National Review called the film \"so slick, yet laborious, convoluted, and enervating.\", adding that Oppenheimer is \"another piece of inscrutable pseudo-art to be left on the remainder shelf next to Criterion\\'s edition of Paul Schrader\\'s Mishima.\"The film has been criticized by some reviewers as a missed opportunity for telling \"how American leaders knowingly risked and caused harm to the health of their fellow citizens in the name of war,\" specifically how more than 13,000 New Mexicans living within a 50-mile (80\\xa0km) radius were not warned or evacuated, but exposed to high radiation levels from radioactive fallout with health-related side-effects lasting for four generations. It did not mention the displacement of farmers of the Pajarito Plateau in northern New Mexico through eminent domain for the building of the Los Alamos laboratory, or uranium mining. As of July 2023, families continue to wait for recognition and coverage by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Emily Strasser, the granddaughter of a Manhattan Project scientist, has criticized the film for depicting what she considers a sanitized version of the events while not covering the effects of the Trinity test and subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki directly.Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody unfavorably compared Oppenheimer to the English Wikipedia\\'s J. Robert Oppenheimer article, writing that the \"simple, fact-heavy article\\xa0[...] turns out to offer more complexity and more enticing detail than Nolan\\'s script does. And it has more to say about the movie\\'s essential themes—the ironies and perils that arise when science, ambition, and political power mix—than the movie itself does.\"\\nAccolades\\nOppenheimer received nominations for Best Thriller, Best Drama TV Spot (for a Feature Film), Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film), and Best Thriller TV Spot (for a Feature Film); and won Best Drama, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, and Best Sound Editing at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. It finished as runner-up for Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\\nInfluence\\nThe renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing pushed the United States Senate to pass legislation which, if passed by Congress, could provide compensation and health care funding to those who were affected, known as the \"Downwinders\".\\nHistorical accuracy\\nThe movie was heavily praised for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real-life events.Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real-life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as it is shown in the movie since he did not know how significant it would be (though the study was released the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the movie). The control to start the implosion of the Trinity Test was likely not a big red button, but instead a switch. Donald Hornig also has his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time, not near it. Truman did say \"Don\\'t bring that crybaby into my office again,\" but not immediately after their meeting.The scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor\\'s apple did occur, but was embellished. It is unclear what chemicals he put in the apple, though it did not seem to be lethal based on reactions to it, though it is likely they used cyanide for audience recognition. It was found out while Oppenheimer was gone, and caused him to almost be expelled.Throughout the movie, marbles are dropped into two glass jars to show the progress of the bombs. This likely didn\\'t occur, but is a representation for the audience on the progress and struggles.The relationship between Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock is heavily debated by historians. Oppenheimer is known to have spent one night with her in Manhattan, but it is unknown if they had sex. Another scene in the movie shows them also together where Oppenheimer says \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\" and is given the Bhagavad Gita. This scene is fictional.Albert Einstein and Oppenheimer did have a good relationship (though they were at odds as they studied different fields), but the conversations shown in the film are fictional (it was Hans Hethe who confirmed and Emil Konopinski who reconfirmed the odds of a chain reaction causing the atmosphere to catch fire were near 0).\\nSee also\\nList of films about nuclear issues\\nList of World War II films since 1990\\nOppenheimer, a 1980 TV series about Oppenheimer, portrayed by Sam Waterston\\nFat Man and Little Boy, a 1989 film about the Manhattan Project\\nDoctor Atomic, a 2005 opera about Oppenheimer, composed by John AdamsReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website \\nOppenheimer at IMDb\\xa0\\nOppenheimer at AllMovie \\nOppenheimer at Rotten Tomatoes '"
